# Stellaris Lite (Current State)

## Project Description
A browser-based space strategy prototype built with React + TypeScript + Vite. It includes a galaxy map canvas, basic system info panels, and a local dev galaxy for offline use.

## Current Features (Verified)
- Galaxy map canvas with systems, hyperlanes, labels, and fleet markers.
- Pan (drag), zoom (mouse wheel), and inertial scrolling on the map.
- System selection via click; selected system is highlighted and shown in a side panel.
- Local fleet movement between adjacent systems with ETA and in-transit animation.
- Dev mode fallback when Supabase env vars are missing.
- Supabase-backed auth (email/password) and galaxy list when env vars are provided.
- Placeholder routes for System View and Empire View.

## How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Supabase Environment Variables (Optional)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Behavior when missing:
- The app runs in dev/offline mode.
- The Lobby shows a Dev Mode panel with “Enter Dev Galaxy.”
- GalaxyMap uses deterministic dev data from `src/game/devGalaxy.ts`.

## Repo Structure (Brief)
- `src/pages/`: route pages (Lobby, GalaxyMap, SystemView, Empire)
- `src/components/`: UI components (MapCanvas, SystemPanel, FleetPanel)
- `src/game/`: dev data and gameplay helpers (devGalaxy, galaxy generation, orders, mock tick)
- `src/lib/`: types, RNG, and Supabase client wrapper

## Known Limitations / TODO
- Fleet movement is local UI state only (no persistence).
- Tick/order processing is stubbed (`simulateTick` is a placeholder).
- FleetPanel is not wired into any page.
- SystemView and Empire routes are placeholders.
- Types are inconsistent (`planetCount` vs `planets`, yields are dev-only).
